                <p>The Williamsburg House in New York’s vibrant Williamsburg, Brooklyn neighborhood is a charming 40–unit building with modern amenities and sleek interior design. With an unassuming exterior that exudes old-school Brooklyn charm, the building surprises residents with its updated features. It offers five common areas for socializing, including a home theater, shared cafeteria, and a furnished rooftop with stunning views of the Manhattan skyline. Outpost Brokerage conducted a study of the market and the building’s composition (all 40 units are 4 bedroom, 2 bathroom with limited common areas and storage), and concluded we should offer it for students and interns.</p>
                <p><strong>As a result, the average unit is rented for $8,500 to $9,000 per month, far exceeding neighborhood comparables.</strong></p>
