		<p class="h5">A Full Residential Experience for Extended Stays</p>
		<p>Home-style, larger and more cost-friendly than typical hotels, our furnished apartments provide you a full residential experience during your stay. Outpost Club offers the flexibility of renting just a bedroom or studio in a coliving arrangement instead of having to rent an entire apartment. Our corporate housing options are also move-in ready, with high-speed WiFi and spacious work spaces — all at 50%–60% less than the cost of a hotel.</p>
		<p>Unlike traditional apartments, corporate housing also allows you to extend your stay if needed.</p>
