		<h2 class="h1 center">Security and cleaning</h2>
		<p>When it comes to corporate housing, safety is a top concern for businesses and their groups. At our properties, we understand this concern and have implemented several measures to ensure the safety of our guests.</p>
		<p>One of the key ways we prioritize safety is through the use of secure lock systems. Our doors are equipped with high-security locks that can only be accessed with a unique key, key card or app. This helps to prevent unauthorized entry and keeps our guests' personal belongings and valuables safe.</p>
		<p>In addition to secure lock systems, we also have a commitment to maintaining clean and sanitary common spaces. Our housekeeping team conducts biweekly deep cleanings of all common areas, including the hallways, stairwells, and public coliving rooms. This helps to reduce the spread of germs and keep the property during their stay.</p>
		<p>Finally, we appoint a designated house leader for each of our properties. This person is responsible for managing the day-to-day operations of the house and ensuring that all guests feel safe and comfortable. If you have any concerns or questions during your stay, our house leader is always available to assist you.</p>
		<p>We understand that safety is a top priority for businesses and their clientele, and we are committed to providing a safe and secure environment for our guests.</p>
