It offers five common areas for socializing, including a home theater, shared cafeteria, and a furnished rooftop with stunning views of the Manhattan skyline. Outpost Brokerage conducted a study of the market and the buildingâ€™s composition (all 40 units are 4 bedroom, 2 bathroom with limited common areas and storage), and concluded we should offer it for students and interns.</p>
