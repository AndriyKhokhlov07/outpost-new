            <p>These Outpost Club Referral Program Rules (“Program Rules”) govern your participation in the Outpost Club Referral Program. The Program Rules are in addition to any agreements between you and Outpost Club. The Outpost Club Terms are incorporated by reference and shall apply to your participation in the Outpost Club Referral Program, including, if necessary, to resolve any disputes between you and Outpost Club related to or arising out of the Referral Program.</p>
            <p>The Outpost Club Referral Program (“Referral Program”) is offered by Outpost Club, Inc. and its affiliates (together referred to as “Outpost Club”) and provides Members who are interested in referring their family and friends (“Referrers”) the opportunity to refer eligible individuals to join the Outpost Club community as new Members. The Referral triggers when the Referred Member signs an agreement and pays first Invoice. These Program Rules apply to both referrers and referred Users, so please read carefully to understand your respective rights and obligations.</p>

                <p>To be eligible to participate in the Referral Program as a referrer, you must (a) be a legal resident of your country; (b) be the age of majority in your territory of residence; and (c) maintain a Outpost Club account in good standing. Referrers must be or have been an Outpost Club member (tenant) and Outpost Club can require proof of a lease or check our own systems to determine this. Referrers may be Members. A single person may use the Outpost Club Platform in several ways (for example, as a Member and Potential Member). However, if you violate the Referral Program Rules or any applicable Terms of Service, Outpost Club may suspend or terminate your ability to participate in the Referral Program under any or all of your accounts. For example, if you are a Member and you engage in prohibited referral activity under your Outpost Club account, Outpost Club may terminate your ability to participate in the Referral Program under all of your Outpost Club accounts.</p>

The Invitation may contain a promotional offer of Outpost Club credit or the special offer to a new Member. You represent that you have the necessary consent from your invitee to send them the Invitation (either directly or through the Outpost Club Platform).

If a Member does not enter your Outpost Club Code you will not receive attribution for the referral and they will not be considered your Referred Member.
